Weather App

Welcome to my solo project, Weather App! As a front-end web developer, I have created this application to allow users to easily search for and view current weather data and images for any city worldwide. With a user-friendly interface and comprehensive weather information, my app is the perfect tool for staying informed about the weather in your area or any location around the world.

Features

Search for weather information by city name
View current weather data including temperature, humidity, and more
View a current image of the city
User-friendly interface
Worldwide coverage

Getting Started

To start using our Weather App, simply download the application and run it on your device. You will be prompted to enter the name of the city for which you would like to view weather information. Our app will then display the current weather data and image for that city.

Conclusion

I hope you enjoy using Weather App and find it to be a valuable tool for staying informed about the weather. As a front-end developer, this project helped me to improve my skills in web development, API integration and creating user-friendly interface. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting Weather App.
